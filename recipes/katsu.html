    <h3>Katsu, a popular Japanese comfort food of breaded cutlets, is commonly made with chicken or pork.</h3>
    <p>Fun fact: The name was adapted from the transliteration of the English word "cutlet" to the Japanese "katsuretsu." 
        Initially, the dish was considered to be a Japanese version of European cuisine (it resembles and tastes a bit like schnitzel), 
        but perhaps owing to the fact that it's often served with miso soup and rice</p>
